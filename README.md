# Psychologist Assistant — LLM Chatbot

This project is a **mental health–oriented chatbot** that simulates a psychologist's responses using a fine-tuned large language model (LLM). It supports both:

- High-end GPU usage with 4-bit quantized models (QLoRA)
- CPU usage for low-resource systems (no quantization)

It uses **Hugging Face Transformers**, **PEFT (LoRA)**, and **Streamlit** for the user interface.
